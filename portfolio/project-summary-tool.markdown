#### Project Description

Project Summary is a tool we've created to use internally, but we now sell as a Saas product. It’s a tool that came about quite indulgently - we wanted to be better at what we do, and we decided to build something to help with that. What happened next will blow your mind.

Firstly, let us tell you a bit more about it.

Project Summary is an Agile project management tracking tool. It does a number of things, but where it excels is in bringing clarity and confidence to your overall project progress.

The basics require you to set up your clients (internal or external work just fine), products, and individual projects that sit within those products, and set some dates and budgets. Simples. A live dashboard that features data drawn from a smart integration with Jira and Harvest means you can review where your project is at and where it’s likely to go in a jiffy (well actually, it’s a graph not a jiffy), meaning you have more time to actually manage the project! Doesn’t that sound just smashing.

Customisable sprint settings with the ability to outline deliverable features and hours allows you to break things down to a comfortable level, and if things change (because of course they do) you can make notes and this will be stored in your project’s history for easy reference later when you need to remind someone of the priorities they’d agreed to but had forgotten about.

The really cool thing about this is that it’s not just an internal tool. You can share this with your stakeholders and they can see the important stuff too. Do away with pesky spreadsheets that need updating and sharing before each WIP and just review Project Summary together instead, or they can log at their own leisure to see where things are at. 

Back to the mind blowing part. We’ve been using this tool for a little while now. Originally it was built as an internal tool, but a few of the people we work with liked it so much they asked if they could start using it. And so the whole Saas product thing began...
