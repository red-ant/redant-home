        <p>Need to take your customer engagement to the next level? Take a look at how <a href="http://www.huggies.com.au/" target="_blank">Huggies</a> is dominating the pregnancy and parenting category by building a site with over 42,000 pages of content, plus lots of interactive tools and member features for over 600,000 members.</p>
        <p>We’ve been working on this site since 2005, and have recently relaunched with a new design, more features and a stronger <span class="caps">SEO</span> (Search Engine Optimisation) focus.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interactive tools that connect with social networks</li>
          <li>Membership system that connects with competition and sampling system</li>
          <li>A large and engaged online community</li>
          <li>Responsive mobile design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Huggies knew they could create an amazing customer experience by developing an informative and fun parenting website. A trusted source to help answer the hundred of questions and concerns that are on the minds of all new parents.</p>
        <p>When we started working with the Huggies team we realised that a robust content management system was required to allow the team to make quick updates to site content. This means content could grow quickly (key for good <span class="caps">SEO</span> results). We also built a new promotion tool. This meant that the Huggies team could quickly set up and run their own web promotions. Rather than contract a promotions company to run a promotion, they could do it internally.</p>
        <p>The combination of lots of content, great tools and generous promotions resulted in a lot more traffic to the site (now over a million visits per month). What needed one server now needed quite a few. And then a few more. In 2011 there was a Volvo car to win, which resulted in over 300,000 entries – one of the most popular online promotions in Australia ever.</p>
        <p>Bits we’re especially proud of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>soft join process</strong> – a quick and easy join process means becoming a member is pretty easy. <a href="http://www.huggies.com.au/join ">Try it out</a> for yourself. The soft join works when joining, asking a question or entering a promotion.</li>
          <li><strong>seamless sign on</strong> – there are actually three different applications that then talk to a separate legacy membership database. One ring to rule them all!</li>
