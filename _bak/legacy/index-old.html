          <h1>The Platform as a Service</h1>
          <p>Like the song goes (kind of) - behind every great team there is a great platform. Wow, that doesn’t even rhyme...</p>
          <p>We’ve been in business for over 20y. And we know that no matter how awesome are developers are, they’ll struggle
            to be consistently fantastic unless everything *just works*. Write some code and it is tested instantly. Set
            up servers for a new project in seconds rather than days.</p>

              <h2>Planning Suite</h2>
              <p>Get the plan wrong and the rest of the project will suffer. These tools help us do group estimates, analyse
                risk, and allocate resources. Oh and some very cool graphs. A day is not complete without graphs. Make sure
                you check the graphs.</p>

              <h2>Architecture Toolkit</h2>
              <p>We’ve made some fairly big things. Complex, tricky projects. And we need to update and keep them running. Rather
                than “oh, you need to check with Milo on that”, our playbooks provide designers and coders with a framework
                for optimising the build from the ground up.</p>

              <h2>Automated Testing</h2>
              <p>Ever been in a situation where you get one thing fixed, and two things break? Turns out you were probably missing
                Tests. For each piece of code a developer writes, they also create a script that automatically tests that
                code, so any errors are identified long before a user sees it.</p>

              <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
              <p>Each line of code is sucked up and integrated into the platform which runs through even more tests, checking
                for unnecessary complexity, bad code or repetition.</p>

              <p>The platform constantly measures live performance based on a set of metrics - anything from user load time

            <p>Yes, Huggies like in the nappies you put on babies. Try searching for anything baby or child related, and you’ll
              probably end up on a Huggies page. So much more than a brand site for Nappies – everything you need to know
              if you’re the proud owner of a 0-5 year old, or if you’re pregnant. Close to half the Mums in Australia are
              members, so we must be doing something right.</p>
