At Red Ant, we have a “mobile first” approach to projects. Mobile technology moves quickly and the number of different devices is growing. Users’ expectation of flawless, continuous service has never been higher. 
	
To deal with this, we have been developing a mobile testing framework that allows us to test our work across a number of different devices automatically. A fresh version of the site is published, and then each of the target devices runs through a series of end-to-end browser tests using virtual users. 

This testing framework allows us to quickly identify issues and manage an ever-growing list of supported devices.
