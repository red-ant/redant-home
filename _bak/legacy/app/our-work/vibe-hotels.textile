h3. Project Description

We re-designed the website for <a href="http://www.vibehotels.com.au" target="_blank">Vibe Hotels</a> giving a new look and feel enhancing Vibe's own personality.

Based on a detailed SEO improvement to increase conversions for online bookings and enquiries and aiming for a better site structure, easier to navigate providing a much better user experience. With the use of great imagery throughout the site, image galleries and video. Setting up the site on open source <a href="http://www.radiantcms.org" target="_blank">Radiant CMS</a>.

Vibe hotels is part of a bigger Hospitality group - Toga Hotels and all the hotel bookings get centralised in one Booking System.

We have developed the functionality by using API to pull the latest and lowest rates and be able to display them on the Vibe site connecting it with the master Booking Engine.
