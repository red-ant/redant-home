Beauty Heaven is the leading independent Beauty site in Australia, and
we're thrilled to be working with them. The site has a thriving
membership, who continually add content and reviews to the site. They
have a really neat-o loyalty system, where members get points the more
they participate on the site- writing reviews of products, comments,
and
forum postings. Members review beauty products, and there is a crack
team of users to that road test various lotions and potions.

This is the latest release is part of a number of changes that we've
been making to the site to improve functionality and performance-
faster, higher and that sort of stuff.

Some of these are new features you can see, such as a new home page,
directory of beauty salons and new signup processes. Others changes
are
not so visible- like the totally rocking page cache that means pages
load quicker and more efficiently. I could go on for hours with graphs
and stuff, but won't bore you here

This latest release involves upgrading from an early version of Rails
(1.3) to the current version (2.3). Rails 2 has seen a massive number
of
improvements, so it's quite a big leap. We used our trusty tool of
choice Capistrano to manage the deployment - so we were able to test
on
our various stages of test servers before releasing into the wild.
