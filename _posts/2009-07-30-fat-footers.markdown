In several recent projects, we've experimented with extending the
footer
area. We've had some mixed results. It certainly seems like a good
idea-
the theory being that the user scrolls to the bottom of the page and
gets a prompt or call to action to go to another page. There is a good
summary of why on [Web Designers Wall (Benefits of Placing a Sitemap
in
the
Footer)](http://www.webdesignerwall.com/trends/modern-sitemap-and-footer/)
that I've summarised here:

- Engage user click and visit duration - theory being that the footer
would be the last thing they see on the page

<!-- -->
- Lazy users who can't find the sitemap can just go to the bottom of
the page

<!-- -->
- Promote specific links

<!-- -->
- Save user's time- allow them to quickly jump from page to page.

<!-- -->
- Save them a click - no need to click to sitemap

<!-- -->
- Enhance layout design (aka - I have no content but want to fill up
my web page)

I've been curious about the impacts of this element, as I've had a few
discussions with people about whether they work, and if a typical user
would ever really scroll to the bottom of the page to see it. Because
I'm really in to that kind of thing and get my rocks off with a good
graph, we've been tracking some metrics around how people use these
footers. This isn't an exhaustive study of the interweb, just our
experience on a handful of relatively popular sites that we've worked
on.

The Good
————

By tracking where and what people click, we've seen that a link in a
fat
footer will generally get more clicks than the **same link** in the
top
navigation. \*Update: the actual uplift or increase in clicks changes
depending on the site, the content and footer layout, and of course
the
time period that you're comparing. The best result we've seen is 620%,
which is pretty nice.\*

This is seems to be **particularly** so for links in the bottom right
corner. If you're still thinking that no one scrolls below the magical
fold, then you might find this article interesting: [Blasting the
Myth
of the Fold by Milissa
Tarquini](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/blasting-the-myth-of) .
Oh-
don't freak out, but you're way down below the fold right now anyway

The Bad
———-

One of the reasons that we thought using a large footer was a Good
Thing
was SEO. It turns out this isn't necessarily the case. Big fat
disclaimer here - we're not an SEO agency, and personally I think the
world would be a better place if Google was switched off every few
days
to give us all a break.

Based on advice from a variety of SEO agencies that we've worked with
on
projects (rather than SEO heresay written in forums and on toilet
walls):

- While it's generally a good idea to link from one page to the next
to promote internal linking

<!-- -->
- its not so great to have every page linking to every other page (or
at the least, lots of pages). It dilutes the meaning of those links.

<!-- -->
- While a search spider can use the footer links to index your site

<!-- -->
- you can achieve this by including a link to your sitemap, plus
using
a valid sitemap.xml file.

<!-- -->
- Having lots of links makes you look more spammy to a spider - above
a certain amount you start looking more like a link farm and less
like a useful content site. And spammy = Bad.

Another reason we liked a big footer was that it made it easier for
users. It turns out **this isn't always the case either**.

We do a fair bit of multivariate design work, which involves testing
different page elements on real users visiting a site. This is testing
what real living users do on a real web site, so the results are
always
interesting. Some users get a fat footer, while others get a thin
footer.

Surprisingly, the larger format footer doesn't always perform better.
Sometimes a smaller thin footer absolutely wallops it. Obviously this
result will be different from site to site, and depends on how you
determine your goal (MVT results rely on having a goal or action that
you can measure at the end of a user session). One theory as to why a
smaller version outperforms is that a smaller footer means less
clutter
on the page. So a user is more likely to click on the goal link than
wander off somewhere else on your site.

Based on these results, I certainly would avoid sticking on a big
footer
just because you've seen it somewhere else. \*[]{.site .our .of
.bottom
.the .at .one .have .we .realised .just .I've .- .Damn}\*. Used in
certain ways, the links in the footer can be very effective and help
users. Putting a lot of links at the bottom of your page might give
you
some advantages, but based on our experiences and results there are
drawbacks as well. I'd certainly avoid the new whitehouse.gov approach
of sticking the whole sitemap down there.
