I had one of those unfortunate meetings the other day. The kind of
meeting that leaves you pondering the Big Questions, like "why am I
even
here?". Is Australia some weird backwater where developers are the
serfs?

My day started bad. I should have just turned around. I was on my
commute in, and the guy next to me was having an unavoidably loud
conversation. Basically, he ran some kind of fintech financial outfit,
and he was having some software developed. This week his plan was to
sack the current development team (they didn't know this yet), and
replace them with an offshore group. Because the offshore guys "would
just shut up and get on with it".

Later that morning some new clients came in to meet with me. These
guys
wanted to tell us about their business, and then see if we were a good
fit in terms of building out the technology side. They went through a
typical startup pitch - the problem, the addressable market, and what
their plan was.

Except there was no plan. They had a basic outline of the problem, and
a
hunch that if we made some awesome software that provided customers
easy
to use and powerful tools, they probably will. Which is fine - we're
totally adept at designing and building out a digital product.

Except for one more thing: they had no money to invest. Oh, and they
didn't actually want to be involved in doing any work. Other than
getting paid. I tried to explain that there is a bit more to it than
just having an idea and finding a developer.
But their eyes glazed over. I realised I was probably in the same boat
as that other development team - why didn't I just shut up and get on
with it?

I totally agree that it would be totally wonderful if Tech was just
like
Mining - you claim the idea (exploration license), you hire a team &
trucks to dig a hole (if you don't like them, you swap them out), you
pull all the stuff out and then profit.

But I didn't shut up and do it. Because the execution matters. I know
it
does. You can have the best idea in the world, but if you can't pull
it
off, it really doesn't matter what your idea was. And you need a
really
smart product and development team to do this. Those stories about a
company valued at a billion dollars with 9 lines of code are just that
-
stories.
