From NYTimes article:

&gt;
&gt; In Australia, Ms. Bridges is best known for her role as the trainer
on
&gt; that countrys edition of the TV show The Biggest Loser. She has
lines
&gt; of housewares and workout clothes sold through discount
department
&gt; stores. She is also the personality behind 12WBT, an interactive
&gt; online diet and fitness program in a country for which obesity
rates
&gt; have grown to 63 percent in recent years. Since 12WBT was
introduced
&gt; in January 2010 in Australia, more than 250,000 people have joined
at
&gt; \\$199 Australian (\\$176) or 12 weekly payments of \\$19.99.
&gt; Now she's bringing 12WBT to the United States, along with the rest
of
&gt; her brand, in an attempt to gain a share of the lucrative diet
&gt; industry. It remains to be seen, though, if theres room for
another
&gt; diet guru in a saturated field.
