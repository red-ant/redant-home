excerpt:
  short: Is traditional broadcast advertising on its way out? The data is certainly giving us that impression.
  long: We look at the Superbowl ad on TV vs. the Dove ad on YouTube. One was exxy to broadcast, the other was free. Guess which one did better in terms of traffic to their respective websites? Yup, you got it.

[Adage](http://adage.com/article?article_id=112835) has published
an
article that looks at the current Evolution campaign for Dove, and
compares the traffic resulting from a Youtube spot vs a Superbowl ad.
Here are the statistics from Alexa, showing performance:

[![alexa graph showing site traffic on www.campaignforrealbeauty.com

The **first bump** is traffic from the Superbowl ad, which cost around
\\$3.75 million to run. The **second bump** is from this ad on
Youtube,
which ran for free:

<object width="695" height="414">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iYhCn0jf46U&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xd0d0d0&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"/>
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/>
<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/>

<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iYhCn0jf46U&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xd0d0d0&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="695" height="414"/>
</object>
The results are pretty compelling- the first spike jumps and then
falters, but the Youtube is massive initially, and then appears to be
gradually tapering. Keep in mind that this isn't traffic watching the
video itself (that is handled on the Youtube site) - this second bump
is
clickthroughs from people that have seen the video, and then are
interested enough to click through to the site itself.

From the [Adage](http://adage.com/article?article_id=112835) article:

&gt; This is a great example of where we're not using the old playbook
&gt; where we do a lot of TV advertising, Todd Tillemans, VP-North
American
&gt; skin care said. He believes the strong consumer insight behind
&gt; Campaign for Real Beauty gave the effort viral legs and that the
&gt; particular message was more powerful because it came from an
objective
&gt; source in the form of the TV news and entertainment programs.

But don't forget that [Youtube does not =
Viral](http://digitalhive.blogs.com/digiblog/2006/10/well_sometimes_.html)
- manufactured viral can cause more damage than you might expect. Just
ask [those hip dudes at
Agency.com](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=agency.com+subway+pitch),
who dreamt up a viral approach for a Subway account pitch but then
pulled out suddenly after creating much controversy and mirth.
