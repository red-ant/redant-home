h2. Huggies Baby Name Finder

"!/assets/uploads/2008/08/bnf.jpg(Baby Name finder)!":http://huggies.com.au/babynames/

The Baby Name finder is an AJAX tool that helps you look up baby names, as well as create a list of favourites to share. We referenced these names against names that members had already chosen for their children - so if you’re thinking about Joshua, we can show you the ten most popular sibling names from families that already have a Joshua.
