excerpt:
  short: A few months ago, we started working with a project management coach. Here's what happened.
  long: We were already awesome, but we wanted more. This time our project managers were in the spotlight, we hired a project management coach to refine our processes and make us and even better team. Better processes equal happy project managers, and happy project managers equal relaxed devs, and relaxed devs equal great work. Sounds alright doesn't it?

A few months ago, we started working with a project management coach.

The aim was to try to improve the way we do things. We already have
lots
of quite tight processes for our technical work, but didnt have any
around managing all the different things that our project managers do.

Each week, we've been working through a different area. One that came
up
was **benchmarking** - trying to work out a way of measuring how well
we're going. We came up with the concept of the perfect dive - each
project being like a diver diving off a board. There are different
types
of dives, but there are a few things you can practice doing right each
time.

Here is a (slightly) shortened version of the way we defined the
perfect
project. We've started tracking each of these at the end of each
project.

The perfect project:

- **The budget** is estimated and agreed. We're on the same page with
the client on requirements and brief. No surprises.

- **Allocation** - the right people get involved, no one is stolen
from another project. Everyone is able to give input early on.

- **Setup** - all our tools like Jira, Harvest and the Wiki are set
up
with schedules, briefs and issues

- **Wiki** - is comprehensive and kept up to date

- **Everyone is happy** - all the team understands the project well,
any client questions or requests get responded to quickly. Our
Client feels totally informed, thinks we're in control and trusts us

- **WIPs** - There are regular team WIPs and standups during the
project

- **Go live issues** considered before launch - like server load and
all the various setup tasks. Nothing got forgotten. PM go-live tests
and checklists are all green.

- **Tools** like Analytics, New Relic and Pingdom are set up. Ongoing
activity reporting set up and PM knows what to keep an eye on.

- **We get paid:** The invoice is sent, client is happy with costs as
they were as budgeted. Total hours were accurate to our estimate.

- **Close out report** sent.

- **We get more projects from this client**
- **No one cried**

We've created a set of survey questions, which gets sent to a project
manager at the end of a project. Hopefully we can start gathering some
useful information and benchmark our project management efforts.
