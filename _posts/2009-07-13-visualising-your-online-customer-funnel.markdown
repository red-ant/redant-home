excerpt:
  short: Refine your user experience and create better ROI by taking an internal look at what happens when your customer visits your site.
  long: Here we look at converting customers from their first visit to your website to the end point at which they either purchase or become fully engaged with what you're offering. By visualising this you can refine the process and create a better user experience and increase your ROI.

One of the ways that you can track customer interaction is through a
conversion funnel approach, which will be familiar to anyone with a
sales background. Coming in at the top of the funnel you have new
customers. In the sales model, you communicate with them in various
ways
by sending them brochures and proposals, and in turn they express an
increased interest in your offering. At the bottom of the funnel are
the
customers that actually commit to your offering. The whole point is to
measure how many people you convert from newbies to customers - your
conversion ratio.

#### Measuring your funnel online

For a site or web application that sells a product or service, the
traditional funnel approach works well since it's relatively easy to
track user interaction on the web. Not only can we track things by
looking at server logs & and page analytics, we can also use database
analysis to gain a much deeper understanding of the interaction.

There is an article by Michael McDerment from
[Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/) (a web site that allows you
to
manage your invoices) on this subject: [How to measure the success of
your web
app](http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/how-to-measure-the-success-of-your-web-app).
In it, he describes a simple model (visit \\&gt; trial \\&gt; buy) as
well as a
more sophisticated approach (visit \\&gt; trial \\&gt; active \\&gt;
pay). He goes
on to discuss ways you can go about measuring your conversion funnel.

Michael also makes the point that the initial funnel is important,
however how a customer behaves once signed up is actually more
important. Do they stay signed up for the next month? Do they even use
the service, or do they find it not useful or too hard, and do they
upgrade to a bigger package?

There is an interesting discussion on working out just how leaky your
funnel is and setting realistic targets for the top of your funnel in
[Measure the Real Conversion Rate & Opportunity
Pie](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2006/11/excellent-analytics-tip-8-measure-the-real-conversion-rate-opportunity-pie.html),
and then [debunked in this
post](http://persuasion.typepad.com/architect/2006/11/your_unreal_con.html).

#### But what if your site isn't about buying or signing up?

What if your site **isn't about** buying or signing up? Many of the
projects that Red Ant works on aren't based on an ecommerce
transaction,
where the customer walks off into the sunset with a product. Often the
reason for being is brand interaction and exposure- a chance for a
company to engage with customers in a way that is simply not possible
in
other mediums such as television. For this kind of site, simple
conversion points (how far along the funnel you are) aren't as
meaningful. What's more, they are harder to measure and assess. In the
sales funnel approach above, the customer represents value to the site
only once they've passed through the end. In this second type of site,
a
customer might pass through many different points of potential value.

Benchmarking is also difficult. First, there isn't an easy metric like
a
sale with attributes (how many items, how much \\$) that can be
measured.
Secondly, the comparisons tend to be a bit vague. For example, at what
point does a customer become engaged - 10 seconds or 10 minutes or 10
clicks? Apart from vague, things can be downright confusing - what
might
seem great customer response (a surge in unique visits) might actually
be bad when deeper analysis reveals that these visitors are just
coming
for a promotion give away, and then rarely return.

#### Visualisation

One of the big challenges is communicating what this customer funnel
looks like, and how it behaves. Once people can visualise what is
occurring, then it's often easier to explain or contextualise
strategies
for the various points.

Here is how we've explained it as an overview:
