  description: An example of when you think you know what you're buying, but end up with something quite different.
  focus_keywords: ecommerce
excerpt:
  short: Ever bought something online that wasn't what you thought it was?
  long: Whilst the advent of ecommerce has brought about the 24/7 ease of shopping from your couch, it's also brought a boatload of potential hassle in meeting your consumer expectations for a product. Make sure you know what you're getting for your money.

How I ended up here:

- I go to a shopping mall, try to buy shoes for my 9yo son

<!-- -->
- First try discount store which shall remain nameless, because
you'll
think I'm cheap. Nothing even remotely child sized - every shoe is
gigantum size or pink

<!-- -->
- Try a specialty kids shoe shop, walk out amazed at the queues. Why
do parents do this to themselves?

<!-- -->
- Think I'm being clever, catch a movie and then try again a few
hours
later. The queues are even bigger.

<!-- -->
- Go home, check shoe size (5) and then jump online. Grab child to
confirm style and colour.

<!-- -->
- Shoes are ordered, feeling smug. I'm the Cool Dad. Yeah.

<!-- -->
- My wife comes home and points out that for children's shoes there
is
toddler size (up to size 12) and then it starts again with "youth"
size 1

<!-- -->
- I check eBay, and yes the description is pretty clear (if I had
scrolled down to read that far) that this is in fact a 6cm shoe

<!-- -->
- [Dreaded
delivery](http://www.benchfly.com/blog/caution-objects-may-appear-larger-than-they-really-are/)
arrives. Luckily there has been a rush on babies at Red Ant recently
(something in the coffee I think), so there are plenty of little
feet.
