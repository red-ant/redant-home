  long: Here are a few of the projects that have been keeping us busy lately. I really should get around to putting them in to our portfolio, but the army of little fairies that live in our server that do all our work (well, the hard stuff anyway) have been a bit slack lately.

Beauty Heaven
——————-

Beauty Heaven is the leading independent Beauty site in Australia, and
we're thrilled to be working with them. The site has a thriving
membership, who continually add content and reviews to the site. They
have a really neat loyalty system, where members get points the more
they participate on the site- writing reviews of products, comments,
and
forum postings. They review various beauty products, and have a crack
team of users to that road test various things.

We've recently rebuilt a Salon review tool, as well as optimised the
signup process and home page.

Kleenex Puppy

This is site that we've been working on for a while now. The product
packaging has been updated, so this design reflects the premium
positioning.

Project 551
—————-

Each year, Japanese whaling ships travel down from Japan to the
Southern
Ocean whale sanctuary. This year they managed to kill 551 whales.

We made this site for the International Fund for Wildlife as part of a
campaign to highlight this. You can submit a photo of yourself making
a
whale tail with your hands, and get it included in a big glossy book.
