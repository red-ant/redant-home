Why we don't enter awards… And why I irritate Wayne.
I have this friend. Let's call him Wayne. He works in advertising. I
don't think I'm being unkind if I were to describe him as being a bit
preoccupied with status. Obsessed would be more accurate.

Wayne has this thing about titles. It is Very Important to him that
everyone knows what his title is, and that is he is an Executive
Creative Director. Not a designer, not a writer, not an art director.
Oh, and what is also Very Important is that he is an Award Winning
Executive Creative Director. With all these awards, you see. Hundreds
of
them.

And it shits Wayne no end when he learnt we had one of these London
International awards (and he doesn't). Apparently they are a Big
Deal —- one of the super prestigious awards. I explained to Wayne how
we won it.

London International Awards
We had an intern. They ran out of work, so I got them to make a list
of
recent work and enter it into a bunch of awards.

At the time, our own site was very strange, cryptic experience, built
entirely in Flash. Such things were all the rage at the time (circa
2001
dotcom). There was this looping music track, and when you rolled over
parts, things popped out and it made more sounds.

We've been around for + 20 years, and we've had lots of different web
sites. I can honestly say this one was one of the worst from a
customer
POV. It was pretty, but there was no way you could work out what Red
Ant
actually did, or even how to contact us if you were intrigued enough
to
find out. There was a phone number in 6pt text, but it was so blurry
it
was hard to read. The loading sequence (anyone remember them?) was
Pixar
level epic- it came in at a healthy 1.4mb.

So our intern entered that site, along with some other much better
projects, into various awards. And several months later we got an
email
that we'd won one. And for some reason which I've forgotten, this then
automatically entered us into the international version of that award.

Several months after that, we got an email asking how many people
would
be attending the award ceremony. In London. Next week.

I thought it was a joke. Turns out it wasn't. And they strongly hinted
that it would be worthwhile that someone was there. So I scrambled
around to try to find anyone that could attend at short notice. To cut
a
long story   short: one of the team had an ex boyfriend who happened to
be
in London. But they'd only just broken up, so it could be tricky. Nice
Ex Boyfriend finally agreed, and was kind enough to turn up in a
tuxedo
to accept this award. Which at this stage I still thought might be
some
elaborate joke.

A few months later Nice Ex Boyfriend came back to Sydney, and we got
our
award. And this big glossy photo of him accepting the award. Weird.

Back to Wayne: he has the shits because this all happened in such a
random way. He doesn't think we really deserve it. I know we don't.
The
other projects were much better, but for some reason some of the
judges
must have really had a thing about that crazy bleeping Flash site. A
subjective decision, based on unknown criteria. And we didn't even
have
our act together to turn up. Wayne would have.

Since then, the awards scene has leaped ahead. You can become "Agency
of
the Year" in about 10 different ways (each industry organisation and
publication seems to have one). Then there are the
flavours —- digital,
mobile, influencer, PR —- the list is endless. Or you might be the
fastest growing (so you doubled your staff from 1 to 2, or increased
earnings a gazillion percent from losing money to making a little
bit).
A few years ago one of the anointed #1 top digital agency was
actually
shut down by the time the award was announced. Each time, an awards
scheme is taking an entry fee. Oh, but there is a party —- Wayne loves
the parties. All that networking with all those other Award Winning
Executive Creative Directors.

So that's why I irritate Wayne. And after 20 years we still don't see
awards as an indicator of anything much. Other people share this view.

You stalk our Streetview and spot the award on top of the bookshelf
near
the ladder. You'll be automatically entered into our prestigious Web
Site Visitor of The Year awards if you can find it!
