excerpt:
  short: We take you through our great new iPhone app designed to help solve those common garden problems.
  long: The Yates Problem Solver is a handy iPhone app that you can take with you into the garden. You can browse through some common (and some unusual) **problems, pests and diseases** that you find in an Australian garden. You can search via plant type, or category (pest, disease or weed). Once you've seen your problem, you can click through to get detailed information.

Most problems have something from Yates that can fix it, and these are
listed with the problem as well. You can read a bit more about how to
apply the solution, as well as **add it to a wish list** if you need
to
duck off to your local hardware store to buy it.

The Problem Solver is a free app, so you can jump on to the Apple
store
and try it out yourself. *[Visit the App

The Red Ants love to try their hands at work that is new and
different.
So when Yates Australia asked us to develop their online garden
problem
solver as an iPhone application, we were excited by the opportunity to
work in this newish technology.

As the Yates website version of the Garden Problem Solver is very
comprehensive, it was important to create an application that synced
with the website data, so any updates/additions to the site where
reflected in the iPhone app.

However, this is was not as easy as clicking a few buttons, so a large
part of the work was developing a tool that sucked the data from the
website in a format the application could work with. But as the most
important and influential part of any lifestyle iPhone application is
the quality of data, we wanted to spend the time getting this right.

One of the best and fun parts of the project was designing the look
and
feel of the application. It was interesting for the Ants to take the
tool from the website and mould it in different ways, to see what
would
be the best user experience. Testing on iPhones and iPods was
essential
and presented interesting scenarios that would have been more
difficult
to consider, and ultimately led to design tweaks and improvements.

The submission process to Apple can be a little protracted -especially
if it needs to get done under the client's name. We ran into a few
problems here, from having the right ABN details through to exactly
who
was going to do what during the submission process. Out tip is to
allow
plenty of time to iron these issues out, as it can be a little fiddly.

Our advice is to be patient with the submission process. We worked
alongside Yates to get all the pieces of information needed by Apple.
Although it took longer than expected to tick all the boxes, in the
end
it was well worth it with the Yates Garden Problem Solver being a
featured application in the Apple AU Lifestyle applications within a
week of being added to the iTunes App Store, and is currently rated
four
stars by users.
