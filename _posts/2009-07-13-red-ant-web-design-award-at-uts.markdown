We've been sponsoring a design award at our local university - UTS.
We've been involved with UTS for a few years now, including doing
studio
visits and professional practice talks.

The prize is for excellence in web design, and is open to any design
student at UTS, but appears to be popular for the Visual Communication
department. The Design school already has quite a strong web design
component, and we thought that sponsoring an award would be an
effective
way of encouraging this.

The award is made available to the student(s) who are judged through
their portfolio and interview to have the most creative and practical
approach to design for web media.

This years winner is **David Chin** - congratulations from everyone at
Red Ant
