  long: Mobile traffic is growing crazy like, in some instances it's doubling year on year. If you're addressing this already by thinking about a mobile aspect of your website, great! If not, read on to get an idea of what you can be doing to make the most of the traffic you're getting and to make yours a user experience to remember.

What started at 5% grew to 10% the next year, then doubled again, and
now some of our sites are over 40%. Email is even more interesting -
checking an email from your phone is now pretty easy, which drives the
mobile vs PC rate right up. Campaign Monitor is [predicting this
month
(Mobile set to surpass desktop and webmail email client usage by
July)](http://bit.ly/LzpeKE) over half of their emails will get
opened
on a mobile device.

So mobile traffic is getting bigger and bigger, and everyone is
feeling
the need to do something. But it can be a bit confusing as to what
actually to do - a common reaction seems to be to build a mobile
application, but this isn't necessarily the most appropriate solution.

Let's start with a basic premise: providing a [better experience for
users on mobile devices (Mobile Site vs. Full
Site)](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mobile-vs-full-sites.html) is
good.
It's something you want.

There are four approaches for improving the mobile experience. These
arent exclusive - as in you don't need to pick only one. In fact,
\*\*our
recommendation is to adopt all four if you can.

1. Check your existing site
—————————————-

The current generation of smart phones have pretty good browsers, so
your site should work OK on them (albeit small). If it doesn't, then
it
is probably an indication that some updates are required anyway. I
suppose what I am saying is that if your site doesn't work on a mobile
properly now (excluding things like Flash and file uploads) then
address
that first, as your site probably breaks on other non-mobile browsers
now.

2. Responsive site layout
————————————-

A responsive layout reorganises itself depending on screen size. So
the
actual page that each device (PC or mobile) gets is the same, but the
layout changes depending on size available. On a wide screen the
navigation bar might be at the top, with an image below it. The same
page when seen on a smaller screen might change to be text only with
no
image under it. There might be a few stages in between big and tiny to
allow for mobiles or tablets with slightly bigger screens - eg: same
navigation bar but no image.

The advantage of responsive is that it just works- one layout can
intelligently resize itself for different sizes. As bigger mobile
screens come out, your responsive layout will adapt.

The disadvantage is that mobile devices are getting the same page -
even
though they can't see some of it. This means the page can be bigger in
file size than it needs to be, which slows things down.

3. Separate mobile pages
————————————

Separate mobile pages means that there is a different URL for some or
all of the pages. When a user arrives on the site, mobile users are
redirected to these separate mobile pages.

The advantage of this is that your page can be crafted just for mobile
users- there might be some features that just don't make sense on a
mobile, so you can drop those. There might be other new, mobile
specific
functionality that you can include just for mobiles. Having separate
pages means page size can be optimised- particularly important for
mobile as they tend to process and render pages more slowly. So a big
plus for the separate page approach is speed.

A disadvantage of separate pages is that youll now need to maintain a
separate version. Whilst this is the case, our experience has been the
effort required to maintain separate mobile pages (using say JQuery
mobile) and a responsive layout is very similar.

4. Mobile app
——————-

Having a mobile app involves building a separate application, and then
getting this published in either the Android or Apple iTunes store.
The
advantage here is that rather than just being another URL, your site
is
now something that lives on the users desktop. They can run your app
directly from their mobile rather than going to the web first.

The downside is the effort and cost of development and publishing.
Whilst I realise there are lots of sites claiming this is easy and
simple, the unfortunate truth is that it takes a while to do properly.
An app needs to be written in a different programming language to your
site, and the publishing process is more involved. Once published,
your
app will live or die based on downloads and reviews. Bomb on these and
popularity will plummet pretty quickly, so it is worth doing properly
the first time. Do it on the cheap and all you're doing is blowing
that
money and setting yourself back another few months.
