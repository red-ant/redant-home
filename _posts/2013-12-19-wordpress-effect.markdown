  long: The growth of tools like Wordpress have had a massive impact on the web development market. It's created two very distinct areas with a huge gap between. One side are marketing sites. These have become very easy to make, and can be set up now in hours rather than months. On the other side are the "digital products" - sites which provide some form of utility and/or data. With these the options and possibilities are endless, and if anything complexity and effort to create \*\*has actually increased.

On one side are the Marketers
——————————————-

Not so long ago, getting a well designed marketing web site which
allowed you to manage content would take a few months and cost say
\\$40,000. This would involve some design and planning, content, and
then
the technical build - ending up with a site where you could manage
content and add new pages.

Today, there are thousands of theme sites. These allow you to browse
different site designs. Pick a design you like, buy it, grab a hosting
package and install your theme into Wordpress. You can even tweak the
theme to use a different colour palette. All that is left is to add
your
logo and write some content.

#### Web design as a product

This has turned web design into a product - one you can buy instantly
for \\$40. This has flipped the process on its head- instead of
spending
time upfront planning and creating a brief, you're picking from an
existing range. Lack of choice isnt an issue- there are millions of
themes to chose from. The only draw back is that there lots of people
with the same site as yours.

Economically this works too - the company making the theme might have
spent say \\$40k designing, developing and testing the theme. But at
\\$40
a pop they are nominally ahead after 1000 customers.

#### The CMS is free

Wordpress itself is free - so you're probably not going to want to pay
money for a proprietary CMS. Many of these CMS tools have rebadged
themselves enterprise as if that makes a difference (I know I always
feel better when I'm browsing a site made with an Enterprise CMS).

#### and hosting is cheaper

At the same time, low end hosting is also easier and cheaper than
ever.
What used to take a day or so (sometimes weeks) now happens in real
time. And you can grab a domain and set up your analytics at the same
time.

#### = pricing tsunami

All of this is a pricing tsunami, putting incredible pressure on
digital
agencies that make this kind of marketing site. There is no CMS
license
to sell, no expensive hosting or setup to manage, and the client is
weighing up whether they need to pay for designs and templates or just
download.

On the other side are the Makers
————————————————

The other side of this chasm are the Makers - companies making digital
products. These are quite different - providing some kind of utility
to
the user and/or data capabilities. They are the sites that you can do
stuff on - send messages, collaborate, buy things, learn something,
etc
etc.

Making these digital products is much more involved - these do take a
fair bit of planning and the options available are quite immense. Not
to
confuse things here, but some people do use tools like Wordpress,
Drupal
etc to build products - so the fact that a site is built in Wordpress
doesnt in itself categorise one way or another. These tools can be
extended to have some of the basic features that a digital product
might
need - like comments, membership, profiles etc. After a certain point
it
makes sense to use a framework like Ruby on Rails or Django - they are
much faster and more powerful. Into that plugs in various database,
caching and server technology options.
