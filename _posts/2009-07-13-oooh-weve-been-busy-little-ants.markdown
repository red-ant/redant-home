We've been super busy over the last month or so, counting down the
days
to our [APEC
lockdown](http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,22145672-28737,00.html).
We're going to stock up on coffee big time just in case George decides
he likes it here and chooses to [stay a bit
longer](http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/bush-may-stay-in-town-longer/2007/08/09/1186530533168.html).

Here are a few of the projects that have been keeping us busy lately:

#### Books Alive

[![Books

Alive")](#)

The Books Alive site is an Australian Government initiative to
encourage
people to read. Rather than listing thousands of titles you **could**
read, the Books Alive site is all about 50 really great books that you
**should** read!

Your personal guide to 50 books so good, everyone will want to read
them.

#### Broadcast Australia

[![Broadcast

"Broadcast Australia")](#)

We created a new visual design and site layout to highlight the
company's most important marketing messages and make it easier for
potential customers to find information relevant to them. We also set
up
a new Content Management System so that content owners inside the
business can update pages almost as easily as updating a document on
their desktop.

#### Huggies Jeans for Genes

"Huggies")](/portfolio/huggies)

We added some denim bling to the header area as part of Huggies
support
of Jeans for Genes day. We also developed a new photo upload tool that
allows members to upload photos of their children wearing jeans. This
is
a reusable tool that will be used in other photo based competitions,
and
includes an extensive image moderation application.

#### Kleenex Wipes

A new extranet application for KC Professional, which contains sales
material and product information for internal staff and distributors.

#### Oxfam Trailwalker

[![Trailwalker](/assets/uploads/2013/09/aug-update-images-trailwalker.jpg
"Trailwalker")](http://www2.oxfam.org.au/trailwalker/Sydney)

The Melbourne walk has come and gone, and just a few more sleeps until
the Sydney event. This is a .net project that we've been working on
with
the Oxfam team.
