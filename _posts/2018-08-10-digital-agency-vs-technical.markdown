excerpt:
  short: I have this friend. Let's call him Wayne. He works in advertising.
  long: I have this friend. Let's call him Wayne. He works in advertising. I don't think I'm being unkind if I were to describe him as being a bit preoccupied with status. Obsessed would be more accurate.

Dear Mum,

I know you still don't understand what I do. After all these years.
And
I really appreciate that you took the time to explain to your Book
Club
what you think I do and ask them. And even though they told you it
sounds like we are a Digital Agency —- we're not.

I'm not trying to be pedantic. It's not that there is anything wrong
with being a Digital Agency. It's just that we're different —- we're a
Technical Agency.

A Digital Agency is what many Ad Agencies became. Creative but with a
splash of digital technology. Tech Agencies are the other
way —- software developers with a splash of creative.

To explain: say you had an idea or product. And you need help
explaining
or selling this idea. You'll need a nice looking web site, some ads to
pop up on other sites, and a catchy brand or cool video. You need a
Digital Agency.

But say you needed to make something. Your idea or product. You want
to
create AirBnB for Book Clubs. Or your company already exists, but you
need to deepen the digital experience. Improve usability. Make it
faster
or better. Then you need a Technical Agency.

The people are also different. An agency team will typically be a
Suit,
a Creative and a Technologist (or at least someone with a lot of
tattoos).

A Tech Agency will have a team of a tech lead, a project manager, and
a
user experience / design person. They'll want to start making things
straight away.

Where this all gets confusing is sometimes the Digital Agency will
have
an offshore "technical partner". I know —- it's confusing, right? If
you were the client why not just deal with the "technical partner"?
They're probably worried about communication and details getting
dropped. Remember that time you tried to sort out your insurance claim
with that offshore call centre? Don't worry, I am sure you're in the
system somewhere. Computers are amazing.
