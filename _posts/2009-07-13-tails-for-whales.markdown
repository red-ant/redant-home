excerpt:
  short: Tails was whales has been a huge success, and we've loved working on it. And now we're making it even better.
  long: Tails was whales is a great campaign to raise awareness for what happens in Japan each year where they set sail and hunt these beautiful creatures. We think it's wrong, and so do a lot of you it seems too.

We've finally launched an update to the 551 project- you can check out
[the sparkly new goodness here](http://tailsforwhales.org).

Basically, each year Japan sends all these boats down to the Southern
Ocean to hunt for whales. Last year they got 551, hence the name of
the
project. Fingers crossed that this year the number will be much lower,
but the only way that is going to happen is if we all hassle, hassle,
and hassle some more.

The Tails project involves taking photos of people making a whale tail
with their hands (take a [look at the
site](http://www.tailsforwhales.org/) to get a better idea). These
photos go into TV commercials, web sites, magazines, and a big book
that
went to our Prime Minister.

Hold off adding your tail pic for a few more sleeps- we're beavering
away on a new upload tool that will allow you to add your image
straight
in to the flash feed. To get the project up quickly, we've done the
design and flash work first. We grabbed all of the images and
associated
information from [the Flickr
group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/551)
and made a JSON feed for the Flash. This will then get replaced with a
new admin tool that will help manage all the gazillions of photos and
allow all the whale lovers to send in their stuff.

We worked on this project with the [Dudes at Republic of
Everyone](http://www.republicofeveryone.com/), and
[IFAW](http://www.ifaw.org). We hope you enjoy it and feel inspired
to
take a few Whale Tail photos of your own.
