Huggies Baby Name Finder
————————————

[![Baby Name finder](/assets/uploads/2008/08/bnf.jpg "Baby Name
finder")](http://huggies.com.au/babynames/)

The Baby Name finder is an AJAX tool that helps you look up baby
names,
as well as create a list of favourites to share. We referenced these
names against names that members had already chosen for their children
-
so if you're thinking about Joshua, we can show you the ten most
popular
sibling names from families that already have a Joshua.
