excerpt:
  short: Shopify for e-commerce - we looked into this as part of a recent assesment.
  long: As part of a recent assessment for a client e-commerce solution we looked into <a href="http://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>. Part of that meant checking out their prices and finding the account level which would hit the sweet spot for the clients needs. In the end we didnt go with Shopify, but this price comparison of their accounts is pretty handy to have on hand.

The graph above charts monthly sales to monthly costs for all four
account levels at Shopify. What it gives us is a pretty
straight-forward
answer to which account is best for anybody who is planning on using
the
service.

- If your sales are below \\$3,000 per month, stick with the Basic
plan.

<!-- -->
- If your sales are between \\$3,000 and \\$24,000 per month, then
the
Professional plan is for you.

<!-- -->
- If your sales are above \\$24,000 per month then the Unlimited plan
is the best value.

There are [other reasons (Shopify
pricing)](http://www.shopify.com/pricing) to switch to higher level
accounts, like to get more storage and SKUs, but if price is the
driving
factor then this simple analysis covers everything.

### Why were we looking at Shopify, and why didn't we use it?

We often have a requirement to build some kind of shop or ecommerce
integration in to a site. Clearly different projects handle this
differently- for a site like [12WBT (Michelle Bridges 12 Week Body
Transformation)](/portfolio/12wbt), the ecomm bit isn't really a
separate shop area - it needs to be very tightly integrated into the
membership process. So we built that. Other projects like
[beautyheaven
(beautyheaven)](/portfolio/beautyheaven) have a separate shop area,
which means building something isn't necessarily the best approach.

A quick summary of the options:

- **Build something** that suits requirements. Advantage is that it
can fit exactly. Disadvantage is that you might have just reinvented
the wheel - ecomm has been around for a while nowâ€¦

<!-- -->
- **Build upon an existing open source shop** - taking a project like
Spree and integrating this. Advantage is that you get lots of
functionality out of the box, and an ability to tweak as required.
No one is clipping the ticket. Disadvantage is that the more you
tweak, the longer it takes in dev time \*[]{.obvious .bleeding .the
.stating .for .apologies}\*.

<!-- -->
- **SAAS** - skin or theme a SAAS system like Shopfiy- advantages
being the shop can be up in minutes, and no hosting to worry about.
The API allows for some integration into your app. Disadvantage is
that any limitations to the API limit what you can do, and you're
paying per transaction- which might not suit some projects.

<!-- -->
- **Install something commercial** - Advantages are that you might
find a tool with the exact shop functionality you want- in which
case happy days. Disadvantages are that it might not fit your actual
requirements

### Two examples of where a SAAS approach like Shopify didn't work
for us

- **Coupons**- we needed to dynamically generate a coupon code in the
main app, and then send that to someone so they could use that in
store

<!-- -->
- **Points/Reward System**- we needed to award points to members
based
on activity in the app. They could then redeem these points by
buying stuff in the store.

That said- if what you're after is a site with the main function of
selling stuff, youd be crazy not to consider a SAAS approach. And
among
the SAAS options, Shopify is certainly a very good option - well
built,
reliable and a well thought out & developer friendly theming system.
