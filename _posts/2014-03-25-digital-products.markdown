Unlike a static site, which might be used for marketing a product or service, these sites <strong>are themselves</strong> the product or service.

A static site usually consists of a number of pages, which might have
a
CMS to allow you to edit content and make new pages. Each page is
essentially static - each visitor gets the same content. Sure, there
might be some multivariate testing running over the top so some
visitors
get different messages, but the core experience is the same.

A Digital Product is different in a number of ways. First, they
provide
utility to the user - to store information, learn new things, or
interact with others. Second, the pages tend to be fairly dynamic,
customising the experience and content based on that user. To give an
example:

- **Facebook** - all members log in and get the same page. But that
page changes radically between members depending on who their
friends are and what they've done.
- **12WBT** - all members get delicious recipes. But the recipe I see
as a female wanting to lose weight will be different to the one you
might see as a male on a strength program. Your weekly nutrition and
exercise plan is completely different, as is your shopping list, the
videos you see, etc.

A static site can be relatively straightforward to build, with a wide
variety of tools available ranging from popular ones like Wordpress or
Drupal, through to more enterprise options like Sitecore or Adobe CQ.

Digital product development is generally more involved, due to higher
technical complexity. The focus is more on the user experience and
providing that utility. Technical problems like caching and site speed
become trickier - speeding up a static site is generally pretty
straightforward, but a page that is different for each user is an
entirely different challenge.

In creating Digital Products, we tend to focus on "features". These
features are things people can do - a simple feature might be to
upload
their profile picture, while a more complex one might be an ability to
customise their meal plans on 12WBT.

Each feature takes planning and effort to create. Some of these
features
need to be in the first release - the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
Others can be released once the product is live. We use a Product Road
Map approach to map out which of these features need to be created
when,
how they are going to interact or build on each other, and when
they'll
be released. Typically we would plan to release new features each week
or so.

### Why bother with giving our users all these features and
functionality?

One option is to create a big static site, and try to fill that with
lots of interesting content. And that is a great solution for in
some/many instances. But there are several reasons to go further and
develop a Digital Product instead:

- **The web site is the Product.** This is what you're selling (even
if you're not charging members for it). If this experience isn't
compelling, engaging and of interest, you probably won't get many
members. And you'll need strong features to do that. Depending on
marketing efforts you may well get lots of visitors, but if you want
them to hang around you may need to provide that elusive utility.

- **Make your users love you** - useful features will increase
utility
provided to users. Which they'll love, and will increase both word
of mouth recommendation and retention - they'll be more likely to
come back.

- **Barrier to competition** - if you're considering investing time
and effort to build a site, consider how easy or hard it would be
for someone else to see your idea and do exactly the same. Tools
like Wordpress are free and can be set up in minutes. Creating lots
of really sticky features takes time to plan and build.
- **Scale**: with a static site, the pathway to growth is to just keep
on adding more pages. But say you have twice as many pages, are you
actually providing twice as much value? Moving to a Digital Product
approach creates pathways to scale and growth. For example you might
want to start doing more advanced member segmentation or split up
your idea into different types or levels of program.

### Why not just build it in Wordpress?

The advantage of tools like Wordpress (and there are others like
Drupal,
Joomla and Expression Engine) is that they allow a site to be built
relatively quickly with key functionality already in place:

- creating and editing page content

- publishing videos

- log in for members
- payment system to become a member

Building these sites also doesn't require a particularly high level of
technical expertise.

It isn't that a large site can't be built in Wordpress- there are
several examples of quite large sites that run WPress. The issue is
more
around when it comes to start adding additional functionality -
complexity of development suddenly kicks up steeply. Ironically, there
are lots of "plugins" available for WPress that make it seem like you
could add pretty much anything. And you can- just not at the same
time.
The issue is these don't all play nicely together- so the forum plugin
might break the SEO plugin, and cause the payment system to stop
working. Something that should take a day might take a week due to
this
spaghetti style complexity.

### Can I just build something simple now and then add later?

Certainly starting bare bones is a good approach - following the MVP
approach your first iteration should be only what is required to
engage
users and get them to join.

However, the path you take at the start will influence your technology
choice. If you build a simple static site now, it isn't really
something
that can be built on to create a digital product.

To use a building analogy, you could build something using simple
tools
like Wordpress, Drupal etc and that is fast to create and relatively
low
cost - a bit like a prefab kit home. Relatively cheap and quick to set
up. And yes, you'll get a one storey house. But if your plan is to
build
a multistorey building or a stadium on top of that, it just ends up
getting in the way.
