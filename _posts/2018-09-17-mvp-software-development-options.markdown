A really common scenario: you've had some code developed, but now you're feeling a bit stuck. Does that sound like you? Typically:

- you feel your dev team doesn't get what you're trying to do
- they are unavailable to do further work
- you need to move faster
- concerns about the work being good enough to commercialise or scale


There are a few key decisions to consider.

The first is whether you want to keep working with your existing developer or not. There might be reasons you’d want to - like they are an investor, a really good friend, they’ve already been paid in equity, you think they understand everything and don’t want to lose that etc etc.

Or these might not be reasons for you.

To address delivery timeframe and quality, (in my experience) you need to increase team size. Developers are usually pretty lousy at accurately estimating effort. Especially on larger projects. And especially if they're the one working on it. Sure, you just may luck out and get that one "10X" developer that can not only do everything brilliantly, but do it very quickly. But back here on Earth, a typical project takes at least a few people with different skill sets. 

I get to see a lot of train wrecks. Companies at various stages, that have made various decisions - some good some bad. At some point, things are no longer working out. They ask for an estimate, a code review or analysis of options. 

Now at this point you're probably thinking that any recommendation we give will be biased towards our technology stack (open source and Ruby on Rails) and our model (dedicated team within a technical agency). But consider this: one of the reasons we've been around for 20+ years is long term working agreements with companies that are a good fit. So whatever insight or advice this article gives you is in our mutual benefit. We have absolutely zero interest in taking on a project that turns out to be a bad fit a few months in.

So- back to the first decision. If you want to keep on working with your current guy/gal, then I’d recommend finding some freelance developers to bulk up the team. This has it's own challenges - you need someone to act as technical lead and manage the team, review code etc. You'll become familiar with the concept of herding cats. But what I’d recommend that you not do is try to get a development team like Red Ant to do some, and your guy/gal to do the rest. This would put you on the fast train to shitsville - it is very hard unless (a) your project is a “commodity” like a Wordpress site where work is  or (b) you have a conflict fetish.

Another approach is to start building up your own team. Obviously this has advantages, but also drawbacks - for example it can be very hard to evaluate and then onboard developers. Particularly if you're not technical or you have other tasks to fill your day. We find it takes about 3-6 months before a new developer becomes useful. We've been working with one startup that had a Ruby platform (we built). Their VCs wanted them to start hiring a team, which they did. These developers started rebuilding the platform from scratch in C#, because although the Lead had experience in Ruby, he preferred C#. And no one was reviewing code or questioning decisions. And making something new is always fun, right? They ended up with very expensive half finished code that replicated existing stuff.

A different approach is to use a dedicated team within a technical agency like Red Ant. You'll get working code faster, with higher quality and scalability. The challenge is being pragmatic with your budget. In this approach the costs are clear (you get an invoice each month) vs the gradual / harder to attribute costs of an internal team. Ideally you want to quickly get to a point  where revenue covers outgoing development and infrastructure costs. Avoid sunk cost fallacy that you may 

There is no right or wrong approach here. There are many examples of successful companies that have used each approach. My suggestion is that you do need to make a clear decision about whether you’re a product company, or a software company that makes a product. Which might get back to you and your company culture.

The next decision is around the existing code. This isn’t something you can decide now - of course most business people would prefer to build on what you already have. We’d need to do a review to get a better understanding. It might be good to go- in which case we can build directly on top (Ruby is pretty good like that). There might be some flags, which we’d discuss with you, and it’s then your decision on whether to keep, fix or redo these. These are very normal - any project typically faces the trade off of quality and time. And there might be some showstoppers - areas that we feel can’t be built on. Again, we’d need to discuss and you’d need to make the call on these. This isn't a simple black and white thing.

Getting a team like Red Ant to take over the project is probably has the lowest risk / best return. You’re getting a more stable product and more predictable outcome. However, this all costs money, and might be more money than you have/want to spend. My advice would be to keep in mind that:

more effort = more code = more/better features. 

Just like other constraints in an Agile project - you’ve got quality, specific features, budget and delivery date that can all move up and down. If you fix one you might need to compromise on another(s). Also consider things like R&D grants that offset costs, and eventual sale of your business. Working with reputable team like Red Ant does make this a lot easier - it will be harder to justify good multiple if your underlying tech is wonky
